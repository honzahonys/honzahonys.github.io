<h1>my voice, tone and style.&nbsp;</h1>
	
	<p>hello, i'm honza. let's pick apart my voice, tone and style.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	
<h2>voice</h2>
	
	<p>honest. sometimes to a fault,  i can be honest about stuff that hurts the other person, but often times it helps people trust my opinion when they really need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>informative. i will tell you all you need to know without pleasantries, in as few words as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>hesitant. sometimes my voice can make it seem that i'm not sure what's going on, or that i'm not sure about myself, it's not really a rule as much as a side effect of my anxiety.</p>
	
<h2>tone</h2>
		
		<p>distant. you might  think i don't like you at first, it can be a curse, but it also allows me to watch social interactions from afar before i decide how to approach it, this can be very helpful.</p>
	<p>understanding. even if i'm getting annoyed or tired i will try to offer my help, and try to understand what something feels like from your point of view.</p>
<p>direct. i do everything last minute, so if we are discussing business, i might be in a rush and need to get stuff done, which can come off as direct or straight to the point.</p>
	
<h2>style</h2>
		
	<p>self-humouring. i like to entertain myself when talking to people, a friendship usually blossoms when people start to catch on.</p>
	<p>casual. even in settings where it's not ideal.</p>
	<p>lowercase. purely stylistic... it can make things feel more casual too.</p>
