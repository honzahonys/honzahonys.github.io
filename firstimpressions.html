i help create brands.
my speciality is brand identity. the main thought behind all my work is to try not to contribute to the plague of bad design everywhere you look, this was sparked in me when i was working on a presentation about visual pollution a couple years back. 🖍️
i find that my best works comes when i'm under pressure, because there is no time to overthink, which often pushes me to more interesting and new ideas. 💾  <li><a href="abt_me.pdf">📎 link to my presentation</a></li>
