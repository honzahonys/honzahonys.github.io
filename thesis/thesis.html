<h1>thesis - Bohemia Motion Pictures rebrand</h1>
	
	<p>2024</p>
	<p>JAN HONYS</p>
	

	
	<p>The goal of my bachelors thesis is to develop a new corporate identity for Bohemia Motion Pictures a.s., which will modernize the companies marketing communication.I use the theoretical section to define key concepts and to analyse BMP’s currect situation, including it’s target market, competitors and existing marketing strategy. In the practical section i delve into the creation of new visual assets and marketing strategy.

	<h2>current situation</h2>
	
	<p>BMP's current visual identity is lacking. Apart from a very dull logotype accompanied by a jingle, there isn't much they do to distinguish themselves visually.</p>
	
	

	
<h2>market analysis</h2>
		
		<p>to better understand what needs to be done, i analysed the market BMP operates in. This includes the Czech film production and distribution market as well as the European film market. Looking at their competition in the Czech Republic, including Falcon, Bontonfilm and CinemArt, BMP could definitely do better after a rebrand. This is even more apparent from their european competition including Film4, Constantin Film and StudioCanal. </p>
		<p>I also looked at BMP's target audience. Given that they produce and distribute a wide array of films from kid's animatio to more complex art films from companies like A24, the new brand has to appeal to almost everyone.</p>

<h2>the path to a new brand</h2>
		
	<p>After research was done, it took many tries to get the logo itself just right. Above you can see 4 of the logos i didn't end up using. </p>

<h2>BMP's new era</h2>
		
	<p>After a lot of work a new logo was created. The meaning behind the B with an eye symbol can be interpreted in two ways. First one is simple, we use our eyes to watch movies. The second one goes a little deeper. What i wanted to do was create a symbol people can somehow relate to, because films are about stories, and those stories have to be human to gain our attention. </p>
	

	
	
	
	<h2>other brand assets</h2>
		
	<p>below is a bunch of examples of the new brand in use. </p>
