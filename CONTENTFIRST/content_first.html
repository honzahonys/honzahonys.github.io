<h1>i help create brands.</h1>
	<p>what‚Äôs most important to me is not to contribute to the plague of bad design everywhere you look, this was sparked in me when i was working on a presentation about visual pollution a couple of years back. üñçÔ∏è i find that my best work comes when i'm under pressure, because there is no time to overthink, which often pushes me to more interesting and new ideas. üíæ</p>
	
<h2>about me</h2>

	<p>in my free time i enjoy gardening, i find it meditative to dig dirt and cut trees all day. i also like to read, though i don't do it nearly enough to mention it here, and lastly, i listen to music every second i'm not with people, it's something i'm very passionate about.</p>

		<p>logo for my primary school. 2013. during a computer class lesson on raster and vector graphics, our teacher showed us a program called inkscape, i immediately proceeded to create a logo for our school, which my teacher said would be pretty good. that's where i discovered you can get paid pretty good money to make little symbols, and in the following years, i worked on a portfolio that would get me into school michael.</p>

		<p>one of the first exercises we did to get to know adobe illustrator. the job was to manipulate letters into a shape. i like the colour combination i used, it symbolises nostalgia very well for me.

this exercise combined learning to use illustrator and understanding how to create cohesive branding.</p>
