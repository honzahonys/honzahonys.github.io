	<p>the topic of visual pollution has been something i've been interested in since my early high school years, i always found it strange how little it is talked about when the impact it has can be quite noticable. in this text i want to define what visual pollution is, and discuss the consequences it has on the world around us, as well as discuss the possible solutions.</p>

	<h2>definition</h2>
	
	<p>visual pollution is the excessive, unpleasant to look at pollution of cities created by advertisement, lights, posters, storefronts, graffitti, and many other elements, all of them man-made. unlike other pollutants that can be measured in some way, and can be scientifically backed to be bad for us, visual pollution is subjective, what one finds unpleasant another might see as decent.</p>

<h2>consequence 1 - aesthetics</h2>
		
		<p>the first and most noticable problem with visual polution is that it creates cities that aren't pleasant to live in. it can make them feel dirty and unsafe. the topic of culturally significant parts of cities also arises, one example is pragues historical centre, which boasts beautiful architecture that is fat too often covered by poorly made advertising, posters, graffiti and more. it causes us to loose touch with the beautiful architecture with rich history around us.</p>

<h2>consequence 2 - environment</h2>
		
	<p>another big consequence of is the inpact it can have on the environment. for example advertisements using light to draw attention can cause light pollution that confuses insects' and other animals' circadian rythm, causing extinction. the other, slightly less bad quality of light pollution is that it is the reason we can no longer see stars in big cities.</p>

	</div>
	
<h2>consequence 3 - safety</h2>
		
	<p>the last consequence i want to focus on is it can be a safety hazard. visual pollution can make our cities straight up dangerous to live in. think big attention grabbing billboards near highways that can cause a car crash. or a traffic sign covered with graffiti. or a pedestrian distracted by a poster.</p>

	<h2>solution?</h2>
		
	<p>so what is the solution to this problem? it is hard to say. there have been some attempts from cities to crack down on visual pollution, some more successful than others. because it is such a subjective topic, it is hard to create a law that clearly defines what is and isn't okay. stuff like the 'cultivating prague' manual is very good at describing to businesses how to help minimise the problem, but it isn't enforcable by law, so there is no reason for businesses to comply.</p>
