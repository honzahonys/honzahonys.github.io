<h1>year in review</h1>
	
	<p>2023/2024</p>
	<p>JAN HONYS</p>
	

	

	
<h2>school</h2>
	
	<p>the most important thing i learned in school is to always have a plan B, a backdoor and to think quickly. i had to figure out what to do when the masters program i wanted to attend was cancelled by v≈°kk. i think it helped me grow and not feel anxious about having to change my future plans. as of writing this it's happening for the second time and i'm handling it much better this time.</p>
	

<h2>internship</h2>
		
		<p>during summer 2023 i had the opprotunity to join the art department of Foundation, an Apple TV+ original series. more important than the practical skills i acquired is that i found out about a different path for a graphic designer, which was really interesting and made me excited to be in this industry after many years of burn out.</p>
	

<h2>personal</h2>
		
<p>in my personal life i have discovered how grateful i am for the people around me, and how important it is to surround yourself with good people. i have also been learning to deal with having a long distance family.</p>
	
	
<h2>free time</h2>
		
	<p>what has been important, though it may seem like a step backwards, is embracing using my free time for relaxing and having fun without feeling guilty or lazy. i have been discovering a lot of books, listening to music without doing anythhing else to fully enjoy i&nbsp; and picked up a game controller after many years. even if i'm in a lot of stress and on a tight schedule, i always try to find time to chill, which has been really important.</p>
